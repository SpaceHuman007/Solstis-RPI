# Alternative Approaches for Procedure State Detection

## Current Issues with Procedure State Detection

Your current system has several accuracy limitations:

1. **Overly simplistic keyword matching** - Basic string matching misses nuanced responses
2. **Lack of context awareness** - Responses analyzed in isolation without conversation history
3. **Binary classification** - Forces responses into rigid categories without confidence levels
4. **No semantic understanding** - Misses synonyms, paraphrases, and contextual meanings
5. **Limited fallback mechanisms** - No intelligent handling of ambiguous responses

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Semantic Analysis with OpenAI Embeddings ✅
- **What**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to understand semantic meaning
- **How**: Compares response text against reference phrases using cosine similarity
- **Benefits**: 
  - Understands synonyms and paraphrases
  - More accurate intent detection
  - Handles variations in language naturally
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.7 (adjustable)

### 2. Conversation Context Awareness ✅
- **What**: Analyzes recent conversation history to inform decisions
- **How**: 
  - Tracks previous assistant messages for context patterns
  - Applies context bonuses to relevant outcome scores
  - Considers conversation flow continuity
- **Benefits**:
  - Better handling of multi-turn conversations
  - Reduces false positives from isolated phrases
  - Maintains conversation coherence

### 3. Weighted Keyword Analysis with Confidence Scoring ✅
- **What**: Enhanced keyword matching with confidence weights
- **How**: 
  - Each keyword has a specific confidence weight (0.6-0.95)
  - Multiple matches accumulate scores
  - Context bonuses applied based on conversation history
- **Benefits**:
  - More nuanced than binary keyword matching
  - Handles partial matches intelligently
  - Provides confidence levels for debugging

### 4. Intelligent Fallback Mechanisms ✅
- **What**: Multi-tiered analysis system with graceful degradation
- **How**:
  1. Primary: Semantic analysis (highest accuracy)
  2. Secondary: Enhanced keyword analysis (good accuracy)
  3. Tertiary: Conservative default (safest option)
- **Benefits**:
  - Always provides a decision
  - Graceful handling of edge cases
  - Maintains system reliability

## Additional Alternative Approaches

### 5. Machine Learning Classification Model
```python
# Train a custom classifier on conversation data
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def train_procedure_classifier(conversation_data):
    """Train a custom classifier for procedure state detection"""
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, ngram_range=(1, 3))
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform([conv['text'] for conv in conversation_data])
    y = [conv['outcome'] for conv in conversation_data]
    
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    classifier.fit(X, y)
    
    return classifier, vectorizer
```

### 6. Intent Classification with Pre-trained Models
```python

def setup_intent_classifier():
    """Setup pre-trained intent classification pipeline"""
    classifier = pipeline(
        "text-classification",
        model="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium",
        tokenizer="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium"
    )
    return classifier
```

### 7. Rule-Based State Machine
```python

    """Rule-based state machine for procedure tracking"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = "INITIAL"
        self.state_transitions = {
            "INITIAL": ["ASSESSING", "EMERGENCY"],
            "ASSESSING": ["INSTRUCTING", "CLARIFYING", "EMERGENCY"],
            "INSTRUCTING": ["WAITING", "COMPLETED"],
            "CLARIFYING": ["ASSESSING", "INSTRUCTING"],
            "WAITING": ["INSTRUCTING", "COMPLETED"],
            "COMPLETED": ["INITIAL"]
        }
    
    def transition(self, response_text, confidence):
        """Transition state based on response analysis"""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 8. Multi-Modal Analysis
```python
def analyze_multimodal_response(text, audio_features=None, led_pattern=None):
    """Analyze response using multiple modalities"""
    text_score = analyze_text_semantics(text)
    audio_score = analyze_audio_features(audio_features) if audio_features else 0
    led_score = analyze_led_pattern(led_pattern) if led_pattern else 0
    
    # Weighted combination
    final_score = (0.7 * text_score + 0.2 * audio_score + 0.1 * led_score)
    return final_score
```

### 9. User Feedback Learning System
```python
class FeedbackLearningSystem:
    """Learn from user corrections to improve accuracy"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.correction_history = []
        self.pattern_weights = {}
    
    def record_correction(self, predicted_outcome, actual_outcome, response_text):
        """Record when user corrects the system"""
        self.correction_history.append({
            'predicted': predicted_outcome,
            'actual': actual_outcome,
            'text': response_text,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
        
        # Update pattern weights based on corrections
        self.update_pattern_weights(response_text, actual_outcome)
    
    def get_adjusted_confidence(self, response_text, base_confidence):
        """Adjust confidence based on historical corrections"""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 10. Temporal Analysis
```python
def analyze_temporal_patterns(conversation_history):
    """Analyze timing patterns in conversation"""
    if len(conversation_history) < 3:
        return 0.0
    
    # Analyze response timing patterns
    time_gaps = []
    for i in range(1, len(conversation_history)):
        gap = conversation_history[i]['timestamp'] - conversation_history[i-1]['timestamp']
        time_gaps.append(gap)
    
    # Patterns that suggest different outcomes
    avg_gap = sum(time_gaps) / len(time_gaps)
    
    if avg_gap < 5:  # Quick responses suggest clarification needed
        return 0.2  # Boost NEED_MORE_INFO
    elif avg_gap > 30:  # Long gaps suggest user action
        return 0.2  # Boost USER_ACTION_REQUIRED
    
    return 0.0
```

### 11. Ensemble Methods
```python
def ensemble_analysis(response_text, conversation_history):
    """Combine multiple analysis methods for better accuracy"""
    
    # Method 1: Semantic analysis
    semantic_outcome, semantic_confidence = semantic_analysis(response_text)
    
    # Method 2: Keyword analysis
    keyword_outcome, keyword_confidence = keyword_analysis(response_text)
    
    # Method 3: Context analysis
    context_outcome, context_confidence = context_analysis(response_text, conversation_history)
    
    # Method 4: Pattern matching
    pattern_outcome, pattern_confidence = pattern_analysis(response_text)
    
    # Weighted voting
    outcomes = [semantic_outcome, keyword_outcome, context_outcome, pattern_outcome]
    confidences = [semantic_confidence, keyword_confidence, context_confidence, pattern_confidence]
    
    # Find most confident prediction
    best_idx = confidences.index(max(confidences))
    return outcomes[best_idx], confidences[best_idx]
```

### 12. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment

class DynamicThresholdManager:
    """Dynamically adjust confidence thresholds based on performance"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.threshold_history = []
        self.accuracy_history = []
        self.current_threshold = 0.7
    
    def adjust_threshold(self, recent_accuracy):
        """Adjust threshold based on recent performance"""
        if recent_accuracy > 0.9:  # High accuracy, can be more confident
            self.current_threshold = min(0.8, self.current_threshold + 0.05)
        elif recent_accuracy < 0.7:  # Low accuracy, be more conservative
            self.current_threshold = max(0.5, self.current_threshold - 0.05)
        
        self.threshold_history.append(self.current_threshold)
        return self.current_threshold
